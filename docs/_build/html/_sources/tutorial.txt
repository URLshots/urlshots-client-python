Tutorial
========

This tutorial will familiarize you with the installation and usage of
the UrlShots python client.

Installation
============

The UrlShots client requires Pytool_ (``>=2.3.2``), Pyconfig_ (``>=1.2.0``), and Urllib3_
these are install for you automatically when you install the Urlshots client via pip or easy_install.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -U urlshots-api    # preferred
    $ easy_install -U urlshots-api   # without pip

To get the latest development version of the Urlshots client, clone the code via bitbucket and install:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://bitbucket.org/urlshots/urlshots-api.git
    $ cd urlshots-api
    $ python setup.py install

Quickstart: Your first screenshot
=================================

This tutorial assumes you already have the UrlShots client installed and working. Right off the bat
all you are required to do is instantiate the API and call the image method with a url string

::

    >>> from urlshots import API
    >>> urlshot = API()
    >>> screenshot = urlshot.image('http://www.google.com')

At this point the ``screenshot`` variable contains a binary image you can...

.. rubric:: Write the image to a file:

::

    >>> with open('image.png', 'w') as open_file:
    ...     open_file.write(screenshot)

Setting parameters
==================

This section will detail how you can get more control out of your screenshot request.
For a full listing of paramters and their description please refer to the :ref:`API Documentation <api>`

As shown above you will want to start with creating an instance of the API.

::

    >>> from urlshots import API
    >>> urlshot = API()

.. rubric:: Delay

Next you can define how long the page should wait after initial load (in seconds).  This
can come in handy in the case of javascript rendering extra elements on the page after ``onLoad``.
(Max: 5 seconds)

::

    >>> urlshot.opts.delay = 4      # Page will wait 4 seconds before grabbing the screenshot.

.. rubric:: JPEG

You can set the JPEG quality on your screenshot as any value between 1 ``min``  and 100 ``max``.  Alternatively
setting this value to ``0`` will return an uncompressed PNG.

::

    >>> urlshot.opts.jpeg = 100      # Will return a JPEG image with 100% quality.
    >>> urlshot.opts.jpeg = 75       # Will return a JPEG image with 75% quality.
    >>> urlshot.opts.jpeg = 25       # Will return a JPEG image with 25% quality.
    >>> urlshot.opts.jpeg = 0        # Will return an uncompressed PNG image

.. rubric:: Compression

Setting the compression flag to a 1 will compress your PNG screenshot to an 8-bit indexed image. (Default: 0)

::

    >>> urlshot.opts.compression = 1      # compression = True

.. rubric:: Timeout

Timeout will tell the page how long to wait for the page to become responsive before returning an error. (Default: 20 seconds)

::

    >>> urlshot.opts.timeout = 10      # Page will wait 10 seconds and return an error if no response from the server

.. rubric:: Actions

::

    >>> urlshot.opts.actions = 'crop:0,0,800,600'      # Screenshot will crop to this specific box size
    >>> urlshot.opts.actions = 'scale:.75'             # Screenshot will be 75% of it's original resolution
    >>> urlshot.opts.actions = 'scale:.75|crop:0,0,800,600'             # Both of the above in order

.. rubric:: Concurrency

::

    >>> urlshot.opts.concurrency = 1      # How many concurrent requests can your application handle?

.. rubric:: Window

::

    >>> urlshot.opts.window = (1024, 768)      # Window resolution to render the page at

.. rubric:: Host (expert)

::

    >>> urlshot.opts.host = 'api123.urlshots.net'      # Only use if you have a special instance assigned to your api key
